# Bag of Curiosity

Bag of Curiosity is a Flutter-based educational app designed to foster curiosity and creativity in children by leveraging the SCAMPER method (Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to another use, Eliminate, and Reverse). This app is developed as part of a PhD thesis by Dr. Shaimaa Taghyan at Assiut University, aiming to explore and enhance curiosity skills in young learners.

### Project Goals

The appâ€™s primary goal is to encourage children to think creatively and explore new ideas by engaging them in structured, playful activities. Using the SCAMPER method, children are introduced to creative problem-solving techniques in an intuitive, interactive environment.

### Key Features

- SCAMPER-Based Exercises: The app includes various exercises that follow the SCAMPER method to encourage curiosity and creativity.

      - Substitute: Encourages children to replace parts of an object or concept with something else.
      - Combine: Allows children to combine ideas or elements to create something new.
      - Adapt: Guides children in adapting elements to new scenarios.
      - Modify: Prompts children to modify parts or aspects for unique outcomes.

  Put to Another Use: Inspires kids to think about alternative uses. - Eliminate: Teaches kids to think critically about removing elements. - Reverse: Challenges kids to reverse parts or sequences to discover new solutions.

- Flutter & MVVM Architecture: The app is developed in Flutter using MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture, ensuring a clear separation of UI and business logic, resulting in more maintainable and scalable code.

- BLoC State Management: BLoC (Business Logic Component) is utilized for efficient state management, ensuring a responsive and consistent user experience across various activities and screens.

- User-Friendly Interface: The UI is designed to be simple, colorful, and interactive, appealing to young users while promoting hands-on exploration.

### Technologies Used

- Flutter: For cross-platform development.

- MVVM Architecture: Provides a modular and structured codebase, allowing for easy maintenance and testing.

- BLoC: Ensures effective state management and clear separation of business logic.
